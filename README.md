# 📉 Unemployment Analysis Project (Advanced)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on an **advanced analysis of unemployment rates** using real-world data.  
The analysis is performed using **Python in Google Colab**, applying data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced visualization techniques to identify meaningful trends and patterns.

The project aims to understand how unemployment varies across **time, regions, and economic conditions**, and is suitable for **data analyst internships, academic submissions, and portfolio projects**.
